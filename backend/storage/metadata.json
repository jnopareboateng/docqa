Utilizing survival analysis methods, includ-\ning the Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model and the Lognormal Accelerated Failure\nTime (AFT) model, the research identifies key predictors of churn and analyzes survival\nrates across different academic levels. The findings indicate that poor network quality\nsignificantly increases both the churn rate and the time to churn. While the Cox PH\nmodel demonstrates superior predictive value, the Lognormal AFT model offers a better\noverall fit. The result has important implications for both Telecel and KNUST, suggest-\ning that enhancements in network quality could improve student retention. The study\nconcludes with recommendations for reducing churn and outlines directions for future\nresearch.\niii\nAcknowledgment\nWe are grateful to the Great and Mighty God for giving us the ability and fortitude to do\nthis task.

crucial role in providing mobile and internet\nservices to people across the country [Bandim, 2022]. The industry is highly competitive,\nmaking customer retention vital for sustaining market share and profitability. Obtaining\nnew customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones due to marketing activi-\nties, incentives and campaigns involved. Therefore, retaining a customer is preferable to\nacquiring a new one. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the\nloss of subscribers or customers who cease using a company\u2019s service or product within\na given period [Koranchirath, 2024]. Understanding the reasons behind customer churn\nhelps to develop strategies to improve customer retention and help reduce churn rates in\nthe long run.\nVodafone is one of the leading national telecommunications providers in Ghana. As of\nJanuary 2020, it had over 9.3 million mobile voice subscribers, representing 13.81% of\nGhana\u2019s market share. Since becoming the majority shareholder, Vodafone Ghana has\nbeen operating the Ghana Satellite Earth Station (GSES) since 2008 [Wikipedia, 2020a].\nGSES allows Ghana to access and utilize communications satellites orbiting the Earth for\nvarious applications, such as telephone services, internet connectivity, television broad-\ncasting, data transmission, disaster management and emergency communications. The\noperation of the earth station by Vodafone Ghana proves the company\u2019s commitment to\ninvesting in and upgrading Ghana\u2019s satellite communications capabilities.\nIn 2016, Vodafone partnered with Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technol-\nogy (KNUST) to provide enhanced packages of services to the various faculties across\n1\nthe university\u2019s campuses to improve education services [Wikipedia, 2020b]. This collab-\noration included telecommunications services such as SIM cards and data plans for the\nstudent and employee communities.\nIn February 2023, Telecel acquired 70% shares in Vodafone, rebranding the company\nname to Telecel in 2024 [Wikipedia, 2024]. This rebranding aimed to improve service\nofferings across voice and data services, money transfers and business solutions. Telecel,\nfounded in 1986, is an Africa-focused telecommunication company that operates primarily\nin Africa and converges telecommunications with fintech, e-commerce and tech startups.\nStudent churn is a major issue every telecom company encounters. It leads to a loss\nof revenue and increases the cost of acquiring new customers. In the highly competi-\ntive telecom market, where customers have multiple service provider options, retaining\ncustomers becomes even more challenging. Companies use modern technology, computer\nsoftware and survival analysis approaches to identify at-risk students and devise strategies\nto enhance retention rates. This method of recognizing unsatisfied customers is known\nas churn prediction.\nOn March 14, 2024, Vodafone, along with several other telecommunications companies,\nwas hit by outages on several underwater fiber optic cables, leading to disruptions in ser-\nvices, particularly internet services [Ghana Web, 2024]. It affected about 10 countries in\nWest Africa, including Ghana. Initially, it was estimated that the problem would be fixed\nwithin 3 days; however, this was not the case. The damage was massive, affecting the\nWest Coast route to Europe, West Africa Cable System (WACS) and the Africa Coast to\nEurope (ACE), resulting in MainOne and SAT3 going offline [AP News, 2024]. The only\nnetwork that was properly functioning at the moment in Ghana was AirtelTigo (AT).\nTo quickly prevent the loss of valuable customers to AirtelTigo, Vodafone (Telecel) took\nthe initiative to update its customers daily on their progress and offer various bonuses to\nprevent customers from defecting to their competitors. This continued until the problem\nwas fixed on April 29, 2024, when the WACS cable was repaired.\nPrevious studies have explored various factors that influence customer churn in a telecom-\nmunications company. This study aims to focus on the KNUST student population, un-\n2\ncover and analyze data gathered from students, apply survival analysis models to identify\npatterns related to churn (such as demographics, usage patterns, etc.), develop retention\nstrategies, evaluate the success of these efforts and make informed decisions.\n1.2 Problem Statement\nRegardless of efforts made by KNUST to partner with Telecel to provide affordable and\naccessible mobile communications services to the university\u2019s populace, churn still per-\nsists. There is a lack of understanding about the factors driving student churn and reten-\ntion, making it difficult to develop effective strategies to address this issue [Kapur, 2018].\nThis research aims to investigate the factors contributing to student churn and develop\na survival analysis model for detecting at-risk students and design specific strategies to\nimprove retention rates. It also seeks to enhance Telecel\u2019s services, improve student\nexperience and foster long-term relationships between Vodafone (Telecel) and KNUST.\n1.3 Research Objectives\n\u2022 The study aims to use survival analysis to estimate student churn rates at various\nlevels.\n\u2022 The paper aims to estimate which covariates affect the churn rate.\n1.4 Significance of the Study\nThe study offers a comprehensive understanding of the factors impacting student churn\nfrom Vodafone. This will enable the development of precise strategies to enhance retention\nrates, thereby minimizing churn. The study will empower KNUST to improve the telecom\nservices offered to its students. By identifying the factors influencing student retention\nand churn, KNUST can work closely with Telecel to guarantee the delivery of top-notch,\ndependable services to its students, thereby solidifying the partnership between KNUST\nand Telecel. The study is all about understanding what the populace expects from\n3\nVodafone (Telecel). By knowing their specific needs and preferences, the services can\nbe improved upon. This means improved connectivity, service plans and less hassle from\nswitching providers. Ultimately, it ensures a more stable and reliable service for students.\n1.5 Organization of the Study\nThe study on student retention and churn for Telecel services at KNUST aims to in-\nvestigate the factors that drive students\u2019 decisions on Telecel services usage. The study\nfollows a structured approach. Chapter one discusses the background information and\nthe foundation for the research. The problem statement and goals are stated here. Chap-\nter two of the study contains a literature review, including several studies related to the\nsubject at hand. The third chapter focuses on the methodology and data collection tech-\nniques. There are several ways of approaching this problem, but the main focus of the\nstudy is using a survival analysis modeling tool. The fourth chapter presents the models\nand practical application to the dataset. Detailed analysis is presented here with the aid\nof figures and diagrams to determine the optimal model for the research. Chapter five\ndelves into the conclusion and summarizes the results obtained. Based on the findings,\nrecommendations are formulated.\n1.6 Limitation of the Study\nThe research is specifically concentrated on students within the College of Science at\nKNUST. As a result, it does not encompass students from other colleges within the\nuniversity. This limitation means that the findings and insights derived from this study\nare relevant primarily to the College of Science and may not be fully applicable to students\nin other colleges.\n4\nChapter 2\nLiterature Review\n2.1 Introduction\nMobile technology has become widely used, changing how students interact, communicate\nand obtain information [Alqatani and Altarifi, 2020]. Student retention and churn are\ncritical issues for universities and telecom companies alike. In the context of Vodafone\u2019s\nservices offered to students, understanding student behavior and preferences is crucial\nfor effective retention strategies. This project addresses this gap using survival analysis,\na statistical method for examining data over time [Box-Steffensmeier and Jone, 2020].\nIn this context, the event of interest is student churn, defined as the discontinuation or\ncessation of Vodafone SIM cards. By applying survival analysis, this project will provide\nvaluable insights into student retention and churn factors.\n2.1.1 Telecommunication Industry and Customer Behavior\nThe telecommunication industry is highly competitive, with customer acquisition and\nretention being pivotal to a company\u2019s success. Research indicates that factors such\nas service, pricing, customer support and competitive offerings significantly influence\ncustomer churn [Lai, 2021].\n2.1.2 Student Retention and Telecom Services\nStudents, as a demographic, exhibit unique usage patterns and service expectations.\nStudies show that reliable connectivity, affordable pricing and additional benefits like\neducational resources influence their choice of telecom services [Smith and Brown, 2020].\nFor telecom companies, understanding these factors is crucial to tailoring services that\n5\nmeet students\u2019 needs and enhance retention.\n2.1.3 History of Survival Analysis (SA)\nThe origins of SA and its history spread far back to the early work on mortality by\nJohn Graunt, who published the book \u201dNatural and Political Observations on the Bills\nof Mortality\u201d in 1662. The concept of \u201cLife Tables\u201d was introduced in this book. A\nnew, modern era in SA started during World War II in the USA, where the reliability\nof military equipment was tested using SA. After World War II, SA became popular\nand spread to various other disciplines [Jerenz, 2008]. The most influential papers on\nSA were published by Kaplan and Meier [Kaplan and Meier, 1958] and Cox [Cox, 1972],\nin which the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator and Cox proportional hazard model\nwere introduced, respectively.\n2.1.4 Application of Survival Analysis\nSurvival analysis (SA) has been successfully applied in diverse fields, including medical re-\nsearch, engineering (reliability analysis), finance and economics. In finance, SA has been\nused to analyze a firm\u2019s vulnerability to global financial crises and identify firms at risk of\nfailure, enabling timely interventions [Lee, 2014, Pereira, 2014, Kumar and Gepp, 2015,\nIwasaki, 2014]. SA has also been employed to predict the optimal time to buy or sell\nstocks within the stock market [Kumar and Gepp, 2015]. In the banking sector, SA is\nutilized to assess banks\u2019 survival during financial crises, measure their strength when\nentering new markets [Leung et al., 2010, Evrensel, 2008] and conduct credit risk anal-\nysis [Tsujitani and Baesens, 2012, Baesens et al., 2005]. The widespread adoption of SA\nacross these domains underscores its versatility and effectiveness in modeling time-to-\nevent data and identifying the factors that influence outcomes of interest.\n6\n2.2 Conceptual Review\nCustomer retention refers to a company\u2019s capacity or ability to maintain or retain their\ncustomer base over a specific period. High retention rates are crucial for maintain-\ning revenue streams, reducing marketing costs associated with acquiring new customers\nand fostering a positive brand reputation. Customer churn, also known as customer\nattrition, is the rate at which customers stop using a company\u2019s product or service\n[Masarifoglu and Buyuklu, 2019a]. It can be caused by various factors such as dissat-\nisfaction with the service, better offers from competitors, or changes in personal circum-\nstances. In the telecommunications industry, market competitiveness is measured by\nchurn rate. Telephone, internet and mobile services are all part of telecommunications.\n2.3 Empirical Studies\nA paper by [Imani, 2020] tackles customer churn in telecoms, emphasizing that retaining\ncustomers is cheaper than acquiring new ones. It evaluates various machine learning\nmethods for predicting churn by comparing classifiers, target detectors, feature extrac-\ntion and feature selection techniques. The study finds that Random Forest and Feed-\nForward Neural Networks with Genetic Algorithm showed high accuracy. Effective tar-\nget detectors included a Spectral wrangle Mapper and an Adaptive Subspace Detector.\nClustering-Based Feature Extraction and Advanced Binary Ant Colony Optimization\nexcelled in improving classification and feature selection. The study recommends imple-\nmenting Random Forest and Neural Networks for effective churn prediction.\nAnother paper by [Masarifoglu and Buyuklu, 2019b] emphasizes the importance of cus-\ntomer retention in telecoms, noting that retaining customers is more cost-effective than\nacquiring new ones. It employs survival analysis to estimate customer survival and hazard\nfunctions, focusing on factors like campaigns, tariffs, tenure, age and auto-payment. The\npaper introduces survival analysis (SA) as a statistical method to analyze time-to-event\ndata. It describes the Cox Proportional Hazard Model (CPHM), a widely used technique\n7\nfor quantifying the risk of an event occurring during the observation period. The paper\nuses Kaplan-Meier estimates and the Cox model to analyze the impact of various predic-\ntors on customer churn. The results show how different factors, such as campaigns and\ntariffs, affect customer survival probabilities. The study finds that survival analysis is\neffective for predicting churn and recommends its use for targeting at-risk customers and\nimproving retention strategies.\nThe CPH model, a well-established method, is known for its interpretability, allow-\ning researchers to understand the relationship between covariates and survival time\n[Nurhaliza et al., 2022]. However, it assumes proportional hazards, which may not hold\nin all cases. In contrast, Random Survival Forest (RSF) is a non-parametric ensem-\nble method that can handle complex, non-linear relationships and does not require the\nproportional hazards assumption. The study uses data from various domains, such as\nmedicine and engineering, to assess the performance of both models. The findings suggest\nthat while RSF generally offers better predictive accuracy, especially in cases with non-\nlinear relationships, CPH remains valuable for its simplicity and interpretability. The\npaper concludes that the choice between CPH and RSF should be based on the specific\nrequirements of the analysis, balancing the need for interpretability against predictive\naccuracy.\n8\nChapter 3\nMethodology\n3.1 Introduction\nThis chapter structures the research methods and procedures followed by the analysis to\npredict student churn of Vodafone (Telecel) in KNUST. A comprehensive explanation of\nthe research models, mathematical formulations and interpretations are presented here.\nThe paper compares their performance using the Concordance Index thus shedding light\non their predictive capabilities.\n3.2 Research Design\nThe study employs quantitative research. This type of research aims to establish the\ncause-and-effect relationships between variables. Specifically, it focuses on quantifying\nvarious aspects of students\u2019 usage and satisfaction, rather than exploring underlying\nmeanings or personal experiences in an open-ended manner.\n3.3 Pilot Survey\nBefore the actual statistics were carried out, a pilot survey was held to grasp the scope\nof students\u2019 understanding of the topic. It was carried out using final year students in\nActuarial Science. Out of 50 questionnaires sent out, a total of 46 respondents were\nreturned.\n9\n3.4 Data Collection\nThe primary data source for this research was a survey conducted among students at\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) in College of Science.\nThe survey targeted students in final years (Level 400). The dataset includes a variety\nof questions, each capturing specific aspects relevant to the study with the aid of Google\nForms.\n3.5 Sample Size\nThe sample size of the research was determined through simple random sampling. Simple\nrandom sampling is a sampling technique in which each member of the population has\nan equal chance of being selected. This method ensures that the sample is representative\nof the population, as every individual has an equal probability of being included. This\nsampling technique is employed to determine the optimal sample size as it is a straight-\nforward method that allows for unbiased estimation of the population parameters.\nThe sample size for simple random sampling can be determined using the formula below:\nn0 = z2 \u2217p\u2217(1 \u2212p)\nE2 (3.1)\nn= n0\n1 + (n0\u22121\nN ) (3.2)\nWhere:\n(N) is the population size.\n(n0) is the initial sample size for simple random sampling.\n(n) is the adjusted sample size for the population.\n(z) represents the critical value.\n(p) is the estimated proportion of the population\n(E) is the margin of error.\n10\n3.6 Data Pre-Processing\nIn the realm of data analysis, ensuring the quality and suitability of data is paramount\nfor deriving meaningful insights and making informed decisions. The initial phase of the\nstudy involved a thorough examination of the dataset to identify and handle missing\ndata appropriately to ensure that subsequent analyses were conducted on a complete and\nrepresentative dataset. One of the critical preprocessing tasks involved the transformation\nof categorical variables into numeric format. This was achieved using label encoding, a\ntechnique that assigns unique integer labels to each category with the aid of Python. The\ntransformation restructured the dataset to facilitate survival analysis. The data was then\norganized to facilitate essential components such as time duration, event indicators and\nrelevant covariates to the variables. The lifelines package played a pivotal role in this\nsection by providing essential survival analysis models in Python. The models are crucial\nfor analyzing data where the time to student churn is important.\n3.7 Concept of Survival Analysis\nSurvival analysis is a branch of statistics used to analyze time-to-event data. The primary\ninterest lies in the time until the occurrence of the event of interest. The time variable is\nusually referred to as survival time since it gives the time that an individual has survived\nover some follow-up period. The event is also referred to as a failure because the event\nof interest is usually death, disease incidence, or some other negative experience.\n3.8 Censoring\nIn survival analysis, not all subjects may experience the event of interest within the study\nperiod. Censoring occurs when the survival time of a subject is not fully observed. It\noccurs when a subject leaves the study before an event occurs, or when the study ends\n11\nbefore the event has occurred for all subjects.\n3.8.1 Right-Censored\nIt occurs when a subject has some loss to follow up or the study ends before the event\nof interest occurs. The lifetime is known to exceed a certain value meaning that, true\nsurvival time is equal to or greater than the observed survival time.\n3.8.2 Left-Censored\nIt occurs when the event of interest has occurred before the study starts and thus the\nexact survival time is known only to be less than a certain value indicating that the true\nsurvival time is less than or equal to the observed survival time.\n3.8.3 Interval-Censored\nIt can occur if a subject\u2019s true but unobserved survival time is within a certain known\nspecified time interval. Interval-censoring incorporates both right-censoring and left-\ncensoring.\n12\nFigure 3.1: Censoring Graph\nC indicates censored data\nX indicates observed events\n3.9 Fundamental Concepts of Survival Analysis\n3.9.1 Survival Function S(t)\nThe survival function S(t) also known as the survival probability function, gives the\nprobability that a person survives longer than some specified time. Let T be a non-\nnegative continuous random variable representing the elapsed time until an event occurs.\nThe probability density function (pdf) of T is denoted by f(t) and the cumulative distri-\n13\nbution function (cdf) is denoted by F(t). The cdf F(t) is defined as:\nF(t) = Pr{T <t} (3.3)\nThe survival function S(t) is the complement of the cumulative distribution function and\nis given by:\nS(t) = 1 \u2212F(t) (3.4)\nS(t) = Pr{T \u2265t} (3.5)\nS(t) =\n\u222b\u221e\nt\nf(u) du (3.6)\nThe derivative of S(t) with respect to t is:\nS\u2032(t) = \u2212F\u2032(t) (3.7)\nS\u2032(t) = \u2212f(t) (3.8)\nIn Figure 3.2 below, the curve on the left is a theoretical curve of the survival functionS(t)\nwhich ranges from 0 up to infinity. It is non-increasing and therefore slopes downward as\ntincreases. At t= 0, S(0) = 1 and when t = \u221e,S (\u221e) = 0 .When actual data is used,\nthe survivor curve does not result in a smooth curve but rather obtains a step function\ngraph. The step function is illustrated on the right in Figure 3.2. The study period is\nnever infinite in duration as there may be competing risks for failure, not everyone may\nobtain the event of interest. The estimated survivor function \u02c6S(t), thus may not go all\nthe way down to 0 at the end of the study.\n14\nFigure 3.2: Survivor Curves\n3.9.2 Hazard Function h(t)\nThe hazard function h(t) denotes the instantaneous rate of failure at time t, given that\nthe subject has survived up to time( t).\nh(t) = lim\n\u2206t\u21920\nP(t\u2264T <t+ \u2206t|T \u2265t)\n\u2206t (3.9)\nh(t) \u22650 (3.10)\nThe hazard function h(t), is given by the formula: h(t) equals the limit, as \u2206tapproaches\nzero, of a probability statement about survival, divided by \u2206 t, where \u2206tdenotes a small\ninterval of time.\nh(t) = lim\n\u2206t\u21920\nPr(t\u2264T <t+ \u2206t|T >t)\n\u2206t (3.11)\n= lim\n\u2206t\u21920\n[\nPr(t\u2264T <t+ \u2206t)\n\u2206t \u00b7 \u2206t\nPr(T >t)\n]\n(3.12)\n= lim\n\u2206t\u21920\n[\nPr(t\u2264T <t+ \u2206t)\n\u2206t\n]\n\u00b7lim\n\u2206t\u21920\n[\n1\nPr(T >t)\n]\n(3.13)\n= 1\nS(t) \u00b7lim\n\u2206t\u21920\n[\nPr(t\u2264T <t+ \u2206t)\n\u2206t\n]\n(3.14)\n= 1\nS(t) \u00b7lim\n\u2206t\u21920\n[\nF(t+ \u2206t) \u2212F(t)\n\u2206t\n]\n(3.15)\n= f(t)\nS(t) (3.16)\n15\nThe hazard function is also known as the conditional failure rate. It is a rate rather than\na probability. In the hazard function formula, the expression to the right of the limit sign\ngives the ratio of two quantities. The numerator is a conditional probability while the\ndenominator, \u2206tdenotes a small-time interval. By the division, a probability per unit of\ntime is obtained, which is no longer a probability but a rate. In particular, the scale for\nthis ratio is not 0 to 1 like a probability but rather ranges between 0 and infinity while\ndepending on whether time is measured in days, weeks, months, or years.\nH(t) =\n\u222bt\n0\nh(x)dx (3.17)\nThe cumulative hazard function H(t) can be derived from the hazard function. It is the\nintegral of the hazard function up to time t. It represents the total hazard experienced\nup to time t.H(t) provides a straightforward cumulative measure of risk or failure over\ntime.\nS(t) = exp\n[\n\u2212\n\u222bt\n0\nh(x) dx\n]\n(3.18)\nh(t) = \u2212\n[\ndS(t)/dt\nS(t)\n]\n(3.19)\nThe equations above clearly defines the relation between the hazard function and survival\nfunction. This can be seen in (3.25) and (3.26) in which the h(t) gives the S(t) and vice\nversa.\n3.10 Approaches in Survival Analysis\nThe approaches to use in survival analysis are underlined by their strengths and weak-\nnesses. The choice is based on statistical assumptions, data characteristics and the com-\n16\nplexity of the survival patterns to model.\n3.10.1 Parametric Methods\nParametric survival analysis is based on the assumption that survival times conform to\na particular statistical distribution. The exponential, weibull, log-normal, and gamma\ndistributions are common models that can be applied to various kinds of survival data\n[Aalen, 2002]. Maximum likelihood estimation, which finds the values that best fit the\nobserved data, is commonly used for parameter estimation. As an alternative, Bayesian\ntechniques can be applied, which refine estimates based on data by combining previous\nknowledge.\n3.10.2 Non-Parametric Methods\nThese methods include approaches that make minimal assumptions about the form of\nthe survival distribution. Common non-parametric methods in survival analysis are the\nKaplan-Meier Estimator, Nelson-Aalen Estimator and Log-Rank Test.\n3.10.3 Semi-Parametric Methods\nSemi-parametric models combine parametric elements (the effect of covariates) with non-\nparametric elements (the baseline hazard function) such as the Cox Proportional Hazard.\n3.11 Kaplan Meier\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimator is employed in survival analysis to analyze the time until\nan event occurs. The Kaplan-Meier estimator calculates the survival probability at a\nspecific time step by multiplying the probability of surviving each previous time step.\nThe estimator is computed as\nS(t) =\n\u220f\ni:ti\u2264t\n(\n1 \u2212di\nni\n)\n(3.20)\n17\nWhere:\nt is a time,\ndi the number of events (churn) at time, ti\nS(t) is the survival probability at time t and\nni is the number of individuals at risk just before time. ti\nThe estimator essentially calculates the probability of surviving from one time step to\nthe next and the product of these probabilities gives the overall survival probability up\nto time t.\n3.12 Cox Proportional (Cox PH) Hazard Model\nThe Cox Proportional Hazards model is a popular semi-parametric model to check the\nrelationship between the survival time and a set of predictors.\nh(t|x) = h0(t) exp(\u03b21x1 + \u03b22x2 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + \u03b2pxp) (3.21)\nWhere:\nh(t|x) is the hazard function, i.e., the instantaneous rate of the event occurring at time\nt given the predictor variables x.\nh0 (t) is the baseline hazard function, representing the hazard for individuals with all\npredictor variables equal to zero,\n\u03b21,\u03b22,...,\u03b2 p are the coefficients for the predictor variables.\nThe coefficients \u03b2 are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation and the model\nassumes a proportional hazard ratio, meaning the effect of the predictors on the hazard\nis constant over time. An important assumption on the Cox PH is that it has a constant\nhazard function proportion for each time. The Hypothesis of the assumption is as follows:\n18\nH0 : The Assumption of Proportional Hazard is fulfilled\nH1 : The Assumption of Proportional Hazard is not fulfilled\nwith the rejection test, if the p\u2212value< 0.05, then the hazard ratios are constant over\ntime.\n3.13 Accelerated Failure Time (AFT)\nWhen the Cox proportional hazards assumption is not satisfied, the parametric model\napproach can be used. Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) is one of the popular parametric\nmodels used in survival analysis. The model assumes that the survival function S(t)\nfollows a parametric continuous distribution. This implies that the distribution follows a\nWeibull, lognormal, or log-logistic distribution. An AFT model aims to account for the\ninfluence of multiple covariates on the survival time by either accelerating or decelerating\nit.\n\u03bb(x) = exp(b0 +\nn\u2211\ni=1\nbixi) (3.22)\nWhere:\n\u03bb(x) is the accelerating factor\nb0 is the baseline accelerating factor when all covariates are 0\nbi is the regression coefficient for the i-th covariate\nxi are the covariates\nH0 : The covariates do not impact the survival time\n19\nH1 : The covariates have an impact on the survival time\nwith the rejection test, if the p\u2212value < 0.05, the covariates significantly affect the\nsurvival time in the AFT model.\n3.13.1 Weibull AFT\nThe Weibull distribution is flexible and can model increasing or decreasing hazard rates,\nmaking it suitable for a wide range of survival data.\nS(t) = exp\n(\n\u2212\n(t\n\u03bb\n)\u03b3)\n(3.23)\nwhere \u03bb is the scale parameter and \u03b3 is the shape parameter.\n3.13.2 Lognormal AFT\nAssumes that the logarithm of the survival time follows a normal distribution. It\u2019s suitable\nfor data where the event time is skewed to the right.\nS(t) = 1 \u2212\u03a6\n(\nlog(t) \u2212\u00b5\n\u03c3\n)\n(3.24)\nwhere \u00b5= b0 + \u2211n\ni=1 bixi is the location parameter, \u03c3 is the scale parameter and \u03a6 is the\ncumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n3.13.3 Log-logistic AFT\nAssumes that the logarithm of the survival time follows a logistic distribution. It can\nhandle both increasing and decreasing hazard rates, similar to the Weibull model.\nS(t) =\n(\n1 +\n(t\n\u03bb\n)\u03b3)\u22121\n(3.25)\n20\nwhere \u03bb is the scale parameter and \u03b3 is the shape parameter.\n3.14 Information Criteria and Loglikehood\nInformation criteria are used to evaluate and compare the relative quality of statisti-\ncal models. They help in model selection by balancing model fit with complexity and\npenalizing models that use more parameters to avoid overfitting.\n3.14.1 Log-Likelihood\nThe log-likelihood function is used in measuring how well a model explains the observed\ndata. It is the logarithm of the likelihood function, which represents the probability of\nobserving the given data under a specific model.\nln(L) =\nn\u2211\ni=1\nln(f(yi |\u03b8)), (3.26)\nWhere:\nn is the number of observations.\nyi represents each data point.\nf(yi |\u03b8) is the probability density function of the data given the parameters \u03b8.\nA higher log-likelihood value indicates that the model provides a better fit to the data.\nWhen comparing different models, the one with the highest log-likelihood is typically pre-\nferred, as it suggests that the model is more likely to have generated the observed data.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to balance this with model complexity, which is where infor-\nmation criteria like Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion\n(BIC) and Hannan-Quinn Criterion.\n21\n3.14.2 Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)\nThe Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is a widely used measure that balances the\ngoodness of fit of the model with the number of parameters. A lower AIC indicates a\nbetter model fit.\nAIC = 2k\u22122 ln(L), (3.27)\nWhere:\nk is the number of parameters in the model.\nL is the likelihood of the model.\n3.14.3 Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)\nThe Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is another criterion for model selection, similar\nto AIC but with a stronger penalty for the number of parameters. This makes BIC more\nconservative when choosing models.\nBIC = kln(n) \u22122 ln(L), (3.28)\nWhere:\nk is the number of parameters in the model.\nn is the number of observations in the dataset.\nL is the likelihood of the model.\n22\n3.14.4 Hannan-Quinn Criterion (HQ)\nThe Hannan-Quinn Criterion (HQ) is used less frequently than AIC and BIC but provides\nanother option for model selection. HQ lies between AIC and BIC in terms of penalization\nstrength.\nHQ = 2kln(ln(n)) \u22122 ln(L), (3.29)\nWhere:\nk is the number of parameters in the model.\nn is the number of observations in the dataset.\nL is the likelihood of the model.\n3.15 Concordance Index in Survival Analysis\nA vital statistical metric used in survival analysis to evaluate the discriminative power of\npredictive models is the Concordance Index, also referred to as the C-index or Harrell\u2019s C-\nindex [Harrell et al., 1982]. It is a gauge of a model\u2019s ability to distinguish across subjects\nwith varying event durations, concentrating on the model\u2019s precision in assigning a person\na risk rating. In order to ascertain if people with higher expected risks actually experience\nevents sooner than those with lower risks, the C-index assesses the concordance between\nthe predicted risk scores and the actual event outcomes.\nC = Number of Concordant Pairs\nNumber of Concordant Pairs+ Number of Discordant Pairs (3.30)\nThis metric is particularly valuable in survival analysis because it provides a single,\ninterpretable summary of the model\u2019s overall discriminatory power. A higher C-index\n23\nindicates that the model is more accurate in predicting which subjects are at greater risk,\nmaking it an essential tool for evaluating and comparing the performance of different\nsurvival models. The C-index has become a standard measure in survival analysis and has\nbeen widely adopted in both clinical and research settings for validating the effectiveness\nof prognostic models.w.\n24\nChapter 4\nResults and Analysis\n4.1 Introduction\nThis section presents the study\u2019s findings and discusses what each output means toward\nthe research goals. It includes tables, graphs and computer results based on the methods\nused. The analysis closely examines details of the model building, diagnostics and evalua-\ntion. The information here was obtained from using python for computer analysis during\nthe research. This chapter seeks to explain the use of survival models in the methodology\nto determine the Vodafone (Telecel) churn rate among students.\n4.2 Data Description\nThe sample size was calculated using the following parameters:\nZ-score (z): A confidence level of 95% is chosen, resulting in a Z-score of 1.96.\nPopulation (N): The population size of the College of Science students is about 2,835.\nEstimated Proportion (p): To maximize sample size, we use 0.5.\nMargin of Error ( E): 5% since the confidence level is 95%.\nn0 = (1.962 \u00d70.5 \u00d70.5)\n0.052 (4.1)\nn0 \u2248383.82 (4.2)\nn0 \u2248384 (4.3)\n25\nn= 384\n1 +\n(\n384\u22121\n2835\n) (4.4)\nn\u2248338.297 (4.5)\nn\u2248338 (4.6)\nThe dataset has a shape consisting of 338 rows and 14 columns from a sample of students\nin KNUST\u2019s College of Science with a population of about 2,835 students. The Churn\nvariable is assigned as the event while the Churn Level is assigned as the time to the\nevent (duration). The remaining covariates are used to explain the event and duration.\nVariable Description Data Type\nGender The gender of the student Binary\nChurn Whether the student has churned Binary\nResidence Place of residence in school Binary\nUsage Frequency Frequency of Vodafone Sim usage Categorical\nVoice Calls Usage of voice calls Binary\nMobile Data Internet Usage of mobile data/internet Binary\nSMS Text Messaging Usage of SMS/text messaging Binary\nData Exhaustion Whether monthly data allowance\n(5GB) is exhausted\nBinary\nMultiple Networks Use of other networks Binary\nPoor Network Quality Coverage Perception of poor network qual-\nity/coverage\nBinary\nUnsatisfactory Customer Service Perception of unsatisfactory cus-\ntomer service\nBinary\nHigh Costs Pricing Perception of high costs/pricing Binary\nMonthly Data Usage Monthly Data Usage Categorical\nChurn Level Level at which the student churns Numeric\nTable 4.1: Description of Variables\n26\n4.3 Descriptive Analysis\nFigure 4.1: Descriptive Analysis of Churn Data\nIn Figure 4.1 above, out of the 338 students, 79 were recorded to have churned. The\nsurvey also recorded 259 students who had not observed the event of interest (churn).\n4.3.1 Kaplan Meier Analysis\nThe provided Kaplan-Meier estimator output in Table 4.2 below summarizes the survival\ncurve in Table 4.1 over the levels in KNUST.\n27\nEvent Time Number of\nStudents\nChurned\nStudents\nSurvival\nProbability\nLower 95%\nConfidence\nInterval\nUpper 95%\nConfidence\nInterval\n0 338 0 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000\n1 338 25 0.926036 0.892497 0.949406\n2 313 22 0.860947 0.819283 0.893630\n3 291 32 0.766272 0.717405 0.807836\nTable 4.2: Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis Results\nInitially, at time 0 in Table 4.2 (when students initially start the academic year), all 338\nstudents are considered to be at risk. With no events (churns) recorded yet, the survival\nprobability is 1.\nAs the students ascend the academic ladder, the number at risk begins to gradually\ndecrease as some begin to experience the event. The higher the number of events, the\nmore the number at risk decreases.\nAt the end of the first year, 25 students experienced the event of interest and therefore\nwere omitted from the study at the beginning of the second year. Anytime the event of\ninterest is experienced, they are omitted from the study until the study duration ends.\nThe confidence intervals (Lower CI and Upper CI) provide ranges within which the true\nsurvival probabilities lie with a certain level of confidence.\n4.3.2 Kaplan Meier (KM) Curve\nThe Kaplan-Meier survival curve below is a tool to estimate the probability that students\nwill remain enrolled in the study over a given period.\n28\nFigure 4.2: Kaplan Meier Curve\nThe x-axis represents the event time (Churn Level). The 0 indicates when the study began\nwhile the 4 represents when the study ended. The y-axis represents survival probability\nand ranges from 0 to 1. Each step down indicates an event, which decreases the overall\nsurvival probability. The shaded area around the line suggests the confidence interval,\ngiving a range within which the true survival curve is expected to lie.\nIn churn prediction, this curve helps identify critical time points where student retention\ndrops significantly and allows institutions to intervene proactively.\n4.4 Cox Proportional Hazard (COX PH)\nIn the Cox Proportional Hazard modeling, two things are mostly done, namely, partial\ntesting for each predictor variable and testing the Cox Proportional Hazard assumption.\nFurthermore, the results of parameter estimation and partial testing are presented in the\nTable below.\n29\nVariable Coefficient ( \u03b2) Standard Error P-value\nGender 0.33 0.28 0.24\nResidence 0.32 0.27 0.25\nUsage Frequency -0.08 0.07 0.27\nVoice Calls -0.57 0.32 0.08\nMobile Data Internet 0.32 0.46 0.48\nSMS Text Messaging 0.48 0.25 0.06\nData Exhaustion -0.20 0.38 0.61\nMultiple Networks -0.13 0.44 0.78\nPoor Network Quality Coverage 2.60 0.35 <0.005*\nUnsatisfactory Customer Service -1.40 0.30 <0.005*\nHigh Costs Pricing -1.13 0.29 <0.005*\nMonthly Data Usage 0.21 0.09 0.02*\nTable 4.3: Cox Proportional Hazards Model Results\n* indicates significant covariate.\nThe coefficient columns in Table 4.3 provide information about the relationship between\neach independent variable and the dependent variable. A positive coefficient indicates an\nincrease in the independent variable is associated with an increase in the hazard (risk) of\nchurn (event). A higher value of these variables is associated with a higher likelihood of\nchurn occurring.\nConversely, a negative coefficient suggests a decrease in the hazard (risk) of churn (event).\nA higher value of these variables is associated with a lower likelihood of churn occurring.\nThe p-value column helps assess the statistical significance of each independent variable.\nA low p-value (using < 0.05) indicates that the covariate is likely to have a meaningful\nimpact on the event. This can be seen in Monthly Data Usage, Poor Network Quality\nCoverage and High Costs Pricing.\n30\nFigure 4.3: Cox PH Forest Plot\nFigure 4.3 above is a forest plot of the Cox PH. A coefficient to the right of zero (positive\nlog hazard ratio) indicates that an increase in that variable is associated with a higher\nrisk of a student churning. A coefficient to the left of zero (negative log hazard ratio)\nindicates that an increase in that covariate is associated with a lower risk of a student\nchurning. The further a coefficient is from zero, the stronger the effect of that covariate\non the hazard of churn. The horizontal lines extending from the boxes are the 95%\nconfidence intervals, showing the uncertainty around these estimates. If the confidence\ninterval crosses zero, the covariate is not statistically significant.\n4.4.1 Cox PH Assumption Test\nThis test checks if the impact of the predictor variables on the hazard rate is constant\nover time. Covariates violating this assumption might need further investigation or trans-\nformation.\nThe null hypothesis states that there is a significant relationship between the predictor\nvariables (such as College and Voice Calls) and the likelihood of a student churning.\n31\nThe alternative hypothesis suggests that there is no significant association between the\npredictor variables and the likelihood of churn.\nCovariate Test Statistic P-value\nData Exhaustion 0.46 0.50\nGender 0.26 0.61\nHigh Costs Pricing 1.74 0.19\nMobile Data Internet 0.63 0.43\nMonthly Data Usage 1.49 0.22\nMultiple Networks 0.09 0.77\nPoor Network Quality Coverage 2.36 0.12\nResidence 0.01 0.93\nSMS Text Messaging 0.04 0.84\nUnsatisfactory Customer Service 0.10 0.76\nUsage Frequency 0.04 0.84\nVoice Calls 2.70 0.10\nTable 4.4: Test statistics of Cox-PH Assumption Test\nThe Cox Proportional Hazard method is an assumption that must be met. In Table 4.4,\nit can be seen that the covariates meet the assumptions as their p-values are above 0.05\nmeaning that there is no strong evidence against the proportional hazard\u2019s assumption\nfor these covariates.\nThis means that the assumption that the hazard ratios are constant over time holds for\nall the covariates.\n4.5 Accelerated Failure Time (AFT)\nThe Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model is a possible alternative that can be used\nwhen the Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) model does not hold. The study uses the AFT\nto understand the direct effect of covariates on survival time.\nModel AIC BIC Hanna-Quinn\nWeibull 316.433303 300.079395 306.67379\nLogNormal 305.805320 289.451411 306.67379\nLogLogistic 307.510343 291.156435 306.67379\nTable 4.5: Comparison of AIC, BIC, and Hanna-Quinn values for different AFT models\n32\nResults:\nThe AFT model with the lowest AIC is: LogNormal\nThe AFT model with the lowest BIC is: LogNormal\nThe AFT model with the lowest Hanna-Quinn is: Weibull\nThe study compares three Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models\u2014Weibull, Log-Normal\nand Log-Logistic\u2014using AIC, BIC and Hanna-Quinn criteria in Table 4.5. The results\nreveal that the Log-Normal consistently has the lowest AIC and BIC, indicating a better\noverall fit despite the Weibull achieving the lowest Hanna-Quinn value.\n4.5.1 Log-Normal Model\nVariable Coefficient ( \u03b2) Standard Error (SE) P-value\nData Exhaustion 0.102 0.148 0.493\nGender 0.032 0.118 0.785\nHigh Costs Pricing 0.515 0.122 <0.0005*\nMobile Data Internet -0.287 0.207 0.165\nMonthly Data Usage -0.069 0.044 0.113\nMultiple Networks -0.104 0.202 0.607\nPoor Network Quality Coverage -1.041 0.123 <0.0005*\nResidence -0.146 0.124 0.239\nSMS Text Messaging -0.228 0.108 0.036*\nUnsatisfactory Customer Service 0.809 0.122 <0.0005*\nUsage Frequency -0.002 0.033 0.940\nVoice Calls 0.132 0.135 0.329\nIntercept (for \u00b5) 1.626 0.393 <0.0005\nIntercept (for \u03c3) -0.616 0.084 <0.0005\nTable 4.6: Lognormal Model Coefficients\n* indicates significant covariate.\nUnlike the Cox PH analysis, the coefficient columns in Table 4.6 provide information\nabout the relationship between the covariates to event time (Churn Level). A positive\ncoefficient indicates a decrease in the time it takes to the event. A negative coefficient\nsuggests an increase in the time to the event.\nA higher value of these covariates is associated with a higher likelihood of the time to\nthe event occurring if positive and a lower chance of occurring if negative.\n33\nThe p-value column helps assess the statistical significance of each covariate. A low p-\nvalue (typically <0.05) indicates that the covariate is likely to have a meaningful impact\non Churn Level.\nThe mu intercept is the mean baseline when the covariates are 0 and the sigma intercept\nis the standard deviation used to estimate the variance to determine the spread when the\ncovariates are 0.\nFigure 4.4: LogNormal Forest Plot\nThe boxes (squares) in the plot represent the estimated coefficients for each factor in\nthe Lognormal AFT model in Figure 4.4. The positive values suggest that the covariate\ndecreases the time to the event (churn), while negative values suggest it increases the time\nto the event (Churn Level). The horizontal lines extending from the boxes are the 95%\nconfidence intervals, showing the uncertainty around these estimates. If the confidence\ninterval crosses zero, the covariate is not statistically significant.\n4.6 Model Comparison\nIn this section, the models used are compared based on the Loglikelihood and the con-\ncordance values. The higher the concordance, the better the model predictive value and\nthe higher the loglikelihood, the better the model fit.\n34\nModel Concordance Loglike hood\nLogNormal 0.958 290.678\nCox PH 0.96 266.68\nTable 4.7: Model Concordance and AIC values\nBased on the comparison of the concordance values and log-likelihood in Table 4.7, it is\nevident that the Cox PH model shows a higher concordance compared to the LogNormal\nmodel, indicating a better predictive value. However, the log-likelihood values suggest\nthat the LogNormal model has a better fit.\n35\nChapter 5\nSummary of findings, conclusion and\nrecommendations\n5.1 Introduction\nThis section provides a comprehensive overview of the findings, conclusions, and rec-\nommendations derived from the study. The primary objective of the research was to\ninvestigate student churn of Telecel in KNUST, aiming to provide actionable insights and\nguidance based on the data analyzed.\n5.2 Summary of Findings\nThe analysis identified that Poor Network, Customer Service, High Costs, Monthly Data\nand SMS are significant predictors of student churn. The Cox Proportional Hazards (PH)\nmodel showed a higher predictive value, while the Lognormal Accelerated Failure Time\n(AFT) model provided a better fit for the data. The study found that Poor Network\nQuality significantly increases both the churn rate and time to churn. Additionally,\nstudents in their 3rd year had the highest churn rate, with 35 out of 79 churners coming\nfrom this group.\n5.3 Conclusion\nThese findings carry important implications for both Telecel and KNUST. For Telecel,\nimproving network quality and reassessing pricing strategies could significantly enhance\ncustomer retention among students. For KNUST, partnering with Telecel to address\n36\nthese issues could ensure more reliable and affordable services, thereby improving the\noverall student experience.\n5.4 Recommendations\nThis section presents recommendations based on the study\u2019s findings. From the analysis\nof the level 400 students in the College of Science over the 4 years, recommendations to\nthe University Information Technology Services (UITS) are as follows:\n1. Improving network coverage at KNUST can reduce churn rates by ensuring consis-\ntent and reliable connectivity. This enhances students\u2019 access to online resources,\nsupports smooth communication and minimizes technical issues, leading to a bet-\nter overall academic experience and higher student satisfaction. Investing in better\ninfrastructure and regular maintenance will help achieve these improvements.\n2. Establishing diverse communication channels and feedback systems through digital\nplatforms ensures that students can get timely and efficient help. This approach\naddresses concerns effectively and improves overall student satisfaction.\n3. Future research could expand on this study by including other Colleges in KNUST\nto obtain a more diverse student population. Using data from the UITS will capture\nstudent sentiments more deeply in understanding the churn of Telecel.\n37\nBibliography\n[Aalen, 2002] Aalen, O.
